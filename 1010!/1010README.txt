Hello! Welcome to 1010! by KingInfinity for the TI-84+CE!
1010! is a puzzle game, originally for the iPhone and similar to Tetris, where you place tiles on a 10 by 10 grid and try to clear rows and columns. Try to survive as long as possible!

Before playing, make sure you have the C libraries, linked here: 
https://github.com/CE-Programming/libraries/releases 

Features include all of the gameplay of 1010, a dark mode, smooth looking graphics, high score, the ability to see your tile buffer and much more!

Controls: 
[Up] [Down] [Left] [Right] to move the tiles around 
[2nd] to place the tile 
[Alpha] to cycle through your available tiles. 
[Mode] to toggle dark mode 
[Clear] to end the game
