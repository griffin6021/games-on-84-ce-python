# games-on-ti-84-pce-python
Guide on how to install games on the TI-84+ CE Python Edition. 
> [!WARNING]
> This guide is for the Python edition exclusivley, because it has more RAM and it is faster. The results are not guaranteed if you use the regular TI-84+ CE.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If your calculator dies, has it's RAM cleared, or has the `reset` button on the back pushed, you will have to reinstall all of your games. You will not have to reinstall `Cesium`, `arTIfiCE`, or `clibs`.

## Section 0- What you need
• An Internet connection
• A USB A - USB B Mini Cable (charging cable)
• A laptop
• Your calculator

## Section 1- Setup
Go to your apps menu, and verify it has the app `2: CabriJr` installed.
Create a wired connection from your PC to your CE via the cable, and then visit the site [ticalc.link](ticalc.link) and follow the instructions. (If a warning message appears, disregard it and continue)
__While completing this portion of the guide onward, do not sever the connection or power off the calculator.__
Install the files `arTIfiCE.8xv` `cesium.8xp` and `clibs.8xg`. `arTIfiCE` is a shell that you can run applications on, `Cesium` jailbreaks the calculator and allows you to run games, and `clibs` (C libraries) is some files that some games need to run.
>We will now run arTIfiCE and start to wrap up the setup process.
>
Launch CabriJr from the apps menu, and press `y=`, `5` and `enter`. Press `enter` once more, then press `del` when prompted, and then `mode`.
Go to the apps menu, and you should see `4: Cesium`. Press `clear`.
>If you see this, you have successfully completed the setup process, and can proceed to the next section. :tada:

## Section 2- The fun part :slightly_smiling_face:
We have set up your calculator, and now we can install all sorts of games, found off of the form at https://www.cemetech.net/downloads/browse/84pce/asm/games . In the `games` branch of this repo, I have a few game files already there. You install these the same way you installed the first three files in Section 1,  using [](ticalc.link) .
> [!CAUTION]
> Due to the amount of RAM on a calculator, it is recommended to install a __maximum of 4__ games for your calculator to still be able to run smoothly.
>
__While installing games, do not open `Cesium` or the file transfer will fail.__ Press `clear` to exit most games and `Cesium`.
Note that some games may require multiple files, and the limitations of [](ticalc.link) are that it can only transfer one file at a time.
>Congrats! You have now installed games on your TI84+ CE Python. Have fun! :shipit:
