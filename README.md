Section 1- Setup
Go to your apps menu, and verify it has the app `2: CabriJr` installed.
Create a wired connection from your PC to your CE via the cable, and then visit the site [](ticalc.link) and follow the instructions. (If a warning message appears, disregard it and continue)
__While completing this portion of the guide, do not sever the connection or power off the calculator.__
Install the files `arTIfiCE.8xv` `cesium.8xp` and `clibs.8xg` arTIfiCE is a shell that you can run applications on, cesium jailbreaks the calculator and allows you to run games, and clibs is some files that some games need to run.
>We will now run arTIfiCE and start to wrap up the setup process.

Launch CabriJr from the apps menu, and press `y=`, `5` and `enter`. Press enter once more, and then press `del` when prompted, and then `mode`.
Go to the apps menu, and you should see `4: Cesium`.
